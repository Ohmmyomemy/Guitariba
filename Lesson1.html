      <center><h4>Do you know about Guitar?</h4>
      <p>If you don't know yet, we'll show you.</p></center>

    <div class="txt-block">
        <p>There are 13 main parts of an acoustic guitar as follows:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="txt-blocka">
        <p>Shall we Begin?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="txt-blockb">
        <p>Of course, the part you can see from the second picture is The head stock of the guitar,<br> which is where the pins are located.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="txt-blockc">
        <p>Yeah, i get it!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="txt-blockd">
        <p>Ok, Good job. <br> let's next to the third part.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="txt-blocke">
        <p>For this part of third picture we call "Machine Heads"<br>It is there to adjust the sound of the guitar from the slack of the strings.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="txt-blockf">
        <p>Ah!,How do i use it?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="txt-blockg">
        <p>Oh!, you just angle them to left hand side for drop<br>and angle right hand side to adjust</p>
    </div>
    <div class="txt-blockh">
        <p>Okay, i will try it.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="txt-blocki">
        <p>Ummm, What is the part of next picture?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="txt-blockj">
        <p>We call "Nut"<br>It is responsible for supporting the turning angle and pressure of the guitar strings<br>that pass from the fingerboard to the head of the guitar.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="txt-blockk">
        <p>Can you explain all the rest?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="txt-blockl">
        <p>Yes, of course.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="txt-blockm">
        <p>In the picture you see this is a small piece of metal. The size is similar to a matchstick.
            <br>Most of them consisted of 20, fixed on a long black wooden square. called the fingerboard
            <br>The function of the frets is to divide the notes of each of them.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="txt-blockn">
        <p>For this we call "Neck of guitar". 
            <br>A long piece of wood that extends from the body of the guitar to the headstock, although this is not the part that directly reflects or transmits sound.
             But the type of wood used to make acoustic guitar necks also affects the overall sound.
             <br>Also important about a guitar neck is the neck profile,as this can either make the player feel comfortable or uncomfortable.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="txt-blocko">
        <p>And a black triangle that you see.
            <br>It has nothing to do with sound, but it plays an important role in composing a guitar.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="txt-blockp">
        <p>And big hole is a "Sound Cavity"
            <br>The sound cavity is the hole in the guitar body that receives the vibrations of the strings, causing the sound to reverberate.
            <br> Inside the sound hole, the wood is bent and laid according to the manufacturer's formula. 
            <br>which will sound different depending on the design.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="txt-blockq">
        <p>As you can see, the beautiful pattern is that the pickguard is responsible 
           <br>for preventing the pick from scratching the body to avoid scratching, and also helps decorate the acoustic guitar to be more beautiful.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-blockr">
        <p>This is a saddle is a support for six cables which are fixed to a bridge.
            <br>The material can be plastic, bone, nylon or other materials and by the manufacturer. 
            <br>Saldle is another point to determine the height-low of the line.
            <br>where the height of the salad must be relative to the nut</p>
    </div>
    <div class="txt-blocks">
        <p>So here this is a bridge or a bridge. 
        <br>is a wooden plate attached to the body as a support The saldle and other cable ties are made of wood, the wood used is usually rosewood or ebony.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="txt-blockt">
        <p>As you can see, it's not a house or a room, but this is an indispensable part. 
           <br>"Top/soundboard" wood panel at the front end (If the guitar is placed horizontally 
           <br>This part of the wood is at the top, so called top wood). This part of the wood is the most important part in the sound of an acoustic guitar.
            <br>It is like the “speaker flower” of an acoustic guitar.
            <br>We sometimes call this top a soundboard because of its sound reproduction function.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="txt-blockv">
        <p>Oh!, i get it all.</p>
