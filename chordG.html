        <center><h1>Example for Chord G pattern</h1>
            <p> place your second finger on the second fret of the A string. 
               <br> To finish the chord,place your fourth finger on the third fret of the high E string, 
                <br> and then strum all six strings. 
                <br> If this is feeling uncomfortable, you can make this shape with your first, second, and third fingers,
                <br> but I really encourage you to use your second, third, 
                <br> and fourth fingers if you can.</p>
